# Deep-Learning-Based-Medical-Image-Classification-System-for-Disease-Diagnosis
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans for disease diagnosis. The program employs a pre-trained model to analyze medical images and generate a report indicating the likelihood of certain conditions, such as pneumonia. The model is developed using TensorFlow and Keras to design a neural network that classifies medical images into categories like "Normal" or "Pneumonia." Additionally, the project features an interactive interface using Gradio, allowing users to upload medical images and receive results in real-time. It also includes an analytical report detailing the number of healthy and affected samples within the dataset.
